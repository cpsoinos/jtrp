If Consignor requests early termination, but has not made the request in a signed document or by email, or has not delivered full payment of the early termination fee and any other amounts due from Consignor, Consignee shall have the option to either continue consignment of the requested terminated Items or discontinue any attempts to sell or show the Items.

If this notification is given after the effective date of termination, the first day of the 10-day Item retrieval period shall be extended to the date of the notification. 
  </li>
  <li>
    At the expiration of the original Consignment Period, if the Items listed in this provision only have not been sold, Consignor shall have the option to renew this Agreement for those Items for an additional 90 days, subject to the conditions of this provision. Consignee shall remind Consignor of the option to renew these Items before the expiration date of their original consignment period. During the first 30 days of the renewal period, Consignee shall advertise each Item at <b>70%</b> of its stated original asking price, and the minimum sale price shall drop to <b>70%</b> of its stated minimum sale price. After 30 days, Consignee shall advertise each Item at <b>60%</b> of its stated original asking price, and the minimum sale price shall drop to <b>60%</b> of its stated minimum sale price. After 60 days, Consignee shall advertise each Item at <b>50%</b> of its stated original asking price, and the minimum sale price shall drop to <b>50%</b> of its stated minimum sale price.

  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Risk of Loss:</b>  If an Item is damaged, destroyed, or lost due to fire, water, theft, damage caused during moving, or any other cause, <b>Consignee shall bear the risk of loss only if Consignee was in possession of the Item at the time of loss. If an Item loss occurs while the Item is in Consignee’s possession, Consignee shall be liable to Consignor for the loss in value of the Item, up to a maximum of the minimum sale price for the Item at the time of loss minus the consignment fee that would have been charged if the item had been sold on consignment</b>. Consignee shall have the right to repair, at its own expense, the damage to any Items caused while in its possession. Consignee shall be deemed to be in possession after the Item has been delivered to Consignee, or, if Consignee has been contracted to pick up and deliver the item to its location, when the Consignee begins to remove the Item from Consignor’s location. If Consignee, subject to the consent of Consignor, transfers an Item to another dealer or seller (such as a dealer or seller who specializes in that particular type of item), Consignee shall no longer be deemed to be in possession of the Item once the other dealer or seller takes possession of it.
